# mpBits
This repository is for technical challenge for Earbits.

The goal is to use a URL pointing to a JSON dictionary containing album information including a link to the music media file, and implement a media player.

This project uses CocoaPods. It uses Alamofire for downloading the JSON file, SwiftyJSON for JSON parsing, and Jukebox to play the media files.

There are no UITests for this app. The use of CocoaPods has minimised the amount of native code.
